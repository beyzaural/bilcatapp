One thing we all gained from the project is that we have learnt to use Android Studio. However, probably the most beneficial experience was getting
familiar with the Google Developer console and using Google services.

Although we have learnt quite a lot in Android Studio, we also think that Android Studio is a pain as well. The most difficult part of our projects so far
has been trying to merge the different projects we have created into a single application, and all those Gradle files don't make it any easier.

If we were to start over, we would not create different projects individually but build one from scratch together. This would increase our chances of 
running into merge errors in GitHub and problems of that nature, but we think that those problems would be easier to handle.
